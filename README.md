# SSHRemoteControl
> This is a remote access program, written in bash script, to anonymously access a weakly-protected Virtual Private Server (VPS), via Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, and conduct a WhoIs query and NMap port scan. This will only work in a weakly-protected VPS.

> 1. Execute SSHRemoteControl.sh with bash

    $ bash SSHRemoteControl.sh

>  2. It will automatically install relevant applications, activate anonymity traffic mask and ask for address of the target VPS.

>  3. It will execute a brute-force attack on the VPS, and install relevant applications in the VPS.

>  4. It will arrive a console where you can choose to carry out a Who-Is query or Nmap scan, where the output will be logged into your local computer.
